<!-- We now add a navigation parameter invoicePath to the detail route so that we can hand over the 
information for the selected item to the detail page. Mandatory navigation parameters are defined with curly brackets.

We add a controller that will take care of setting the item's context on the view and bind some properties of the 
ObjectHeader to the fields of our invoice model. We could add more detailed information from the invoice object here,
 but for simplicity reasons we just display two fields for now.
 
 On the detail page, we tell the control to display a back button by setting the parameter showNavButton 
 to true and register an event handler that is called when the back button is pressed.
