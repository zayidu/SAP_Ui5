The head part will be used by the browser to process the document. 
Using meta tags we can influence the behavior of the browser.

In this case we will tell the browser to use UTF-8 as the document character set. We will also give our app a title that 
will be displayed in the browser. Be aware that our hard-coded title can be overruled by the app, for example to show a 
title in the language of the user.

SAPUI5 is a JavaScript library that can either be loaded from the same Web server where the app resides, 
or from a different server. If SAPUI5 is deployed somewhere else on the server or you want to use a different 
server, then you need to adjust the corresponding paths in the bootstrap (here: src="/resources/sap-ui-core.js") 
in this tutorial according to your own requirements.

You can use this reference to the latest stable version of SAPUI5 for the tutorial or for testing purposes, 
but never use this for productive use. In an actual app, you always have to specify an SAPUI5 version explicitly.

For more information about the CDN, see Variant for Bootstrapping from Content Delivery Network.

In case you are using SAP Web IDE, you can right-click the project and select New  HTML5 Application Descriptor 
to make the /resources… reference work. This creates the neo-app.json file, which configures a URL mapping for this path.

<script

In this step, we load the SAPUI5 framework from our local webserver and initialize the core modules 
with the following configuration options:
The src attribute of the <script> tag tells the browser where to find the SAPUI5 core library 
– it initializes the SAPUI5 runtime and loads additional resources, such as the libraries specified 
in the data-sap-ui-libs attribute.

The SAPUI5 controls support different themes, we choose sap_belize as our default theme.

We specify the required UI library sap.m containing the UI controls we need for this tutorial.

To make use of the most recent functionality of SAPUI5 we define the compatibility version as edge.

We configure the process of “bootstrapping” to run asynchronously.

This means that the SAPUI5 resources can be loaded simultaneously in the background for performance reasons.

We define the module to be loaded initially in a declarative way. With this, we avoid directly executable 
JavaScript code in the HTML file. This makes your app more secure. We will create the script that this references 
to further down in this step.
We tell SAPUI5 core that resources in the sap.ui.demo.walkthrough namespace are located in the same folder 
as index.html. This is, for example, necessary for apps that run in the SAP Fiori launchpad.
