<!-- 
SAPUI5 supports multiple view types (XML, HTML, JavaScript). 
We choose XML as this produces the most readable code and will force us to separate 
the view declaration from the controller logic. Yet the look of our UI will not change.

Inside the view tag, we add the declarative definition of our text control with the 
same properties as in the previous step. The XML tags are mapped to controls and the 
attributes are mapped to the properties of the control.

Conventions:
View names are capitalized

All views are stored in the view folder

Names of XML views always end with *.view.xml

The default XML namespace is sap.m

Other XML namespaces use the last part of the SAP namespace as alias (for example, mvc for sap.ui.core.mvc)

We add a reference to the controller, and replace the text control with a button with text “Say Hello”. 
The button triggers the .onShowHello event handler function when being pressed. We also have to specify 
the name of the controller that is connected to the view and holds the .onShowHello function by setting 
the controllerName attribute of the view.

A view does not necessarily need an explicitly assigned controller. You do not have to create a controller 
if the view is just displaying information and no additional functionality is required. If a controller is specified, 
it is instantiated after the view is loaded.

We add an sap.m.Input control to the view. With this, the user can enter a recipient 
for the greetings. We bind its value to a SAPUI5 model by using the declarative binding 
syntax for XML views:

The curly brackets {…} indicate that data is taken from the value of the recipient's 
object name property. This is called "data binding".

/recipient/name declares the path in the model.


The binding of the value attribute is a simple binding example that contains only a 
binding pattern. We can also combine texts and binding pattern to a more complex binding 
result as seen in the description attribute. To be able to use the so-called complex binding 
syntax we have to enable it globally by setting the bootstrap parameter data-sap-ui-compatVersion to edge. 
If this setting is omitted, then only standard binding syntax is allowed, meaning "Hello {/recipient/name}" 
would not work anymore while "{/recipient/name}" would work just fine.

Note
You can either use data-sap-ui-compatVersion="edge" or data-sap-ui-bindingSyntax="complex" in the script. 
By setting the "edge" compatibility mode, the complex binding syntax is automatically enabled. 
The edge mode automatically enables compatibility features that otherwise would have to be enabled manually. 
For more information, see Compatibility Version Information.

We create the folder webapp/i18n and the file i18n.properties inside. 
The resolved bundle name is sap.ui.demo.walkthrough.i18n, as we will see later. 
The properties file for texts contains name-value pairs for each element. 
You can add any number of parameters to the texts by adding numbers in curly brackets to them. 
These numbers correspond to the sequence in which the parameters are accessed (starting with 0).

In this tutorial we will only have one properties file. However, in real-world projects, 
you would have a separate file for each supported language with a suffix for the locale, 
for example i18n_de.properties for German, i18n_en.properties for English, and so on. When a user runs the app, 
SAPUI5 will load the language file that fits best to the user's environment.

In the XML view, we use data binding to connect the button text to the ButtonText property 
in the i18n model. A resource bundle is a flat structure, therefore the preceding slash (/) can be omitted for the path.

Note
The description text is not completely localized in this example for illustration purposes. 
To be on the safe side, we would have to use a similar mechanism as in the controller to use a
 string from the resource bundle and replace parts of it. This can be done with the jQuery.sap.formatMessage formatter.

Furthermore, i18n files only impact client-side application texts. Texts that are loaded from 
back-end systems can appear in all languages that are supported by the back-end system.

Conventions
The resource model for internationalization is called the i18n model.

The default filename is i18n.properties.

Resource bundle keys are written in (lower) camelCase.

Resource bundle values can contain parameters like {0}, {1}, {2}, …

Never concatenate strings that are translated, always use placeholders.

Use Unicode escape sequences for special characters.
